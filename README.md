# Role Based Access Control App

A React-based web application for managing users, allowing you to add, edit, delete, and toggle user status. This project utilizes **React** for building the UI, **Tailwind css** for styling and **Redux** for state management.

## Project Overview

The **Role Based Access Control** allows users to manage a list of users with the ability to:

- Add new users.
- Edit existing users' information (name and role).
- Toggle user status between **Active** and **Inactive**.
- Delete users from the list.

It uses **React** for the front-end and **Redux** for state management, making it easy to manage the state of users across the app.

## User Experience

- There are two tabs (manage roles, manage users) to make the UX better.
- Impressive UI of the app so it feels good when the runs this app.
 

## Features

- **Add User**: Easily add new users with default roles and statuses.
- **Edit User**: Update the name and role of an existing user.
- **Delete User**: Remove a user from the list.
- **Toggle Status**: Switch a user's status between "Active" and "Inactive."
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly search for users by their name to find specific individuals in the user list.
- **Filter by Status**: Filter the user list to show only Active or Inactive users, making it easier to manage users based on their current status.
- **Responsive UI**: The app is designed to be responsive, providing a smooth experience across devices (with additional improvements planned).
- **User Management**: A clean, organized table to manage user data, including name, role, and status.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, used for managing application state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **UUID**: A library for generating unique IDs (used for user identification).
- **React-Redux**: The official React bindings for Redux, allowing React components to interact with the Redux store.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript features for cleaner, more efficient code.
- **React Hooks**: Utilizing state and lifecycle features in function components.


### Explanation of the directories:

- **public/**: Contains static files that will be publicly accessible.
- **src/**: Contains the source code of the React application.
  - **components/**: Contains React components used throughout the app.
  - **store/**: Contains Redux-related files (actions, reducers, and store configuration).
  - **styles/**: If you're using custom styles or configuration files (e.g., Tailwind CSS), they will be here.
- **package.json**: Contains metadata about the project and its dependencies.
- **README.md**: This file with documentation about the project.


## Future Improvements

### 1. **User Authentication**
   - Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token) or OAuth to allow different user roles (e.g., Admin, Viewer) and secure access to user management features.

### 2. **Pagination**
   - Add pagination or infinite scrolling to the user list to improve performance when managing a large number of users. Use libraries like `react-paginate` for easier implementation.

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading for components that are not immediately required to reduce the initial bundle size and optimize the app's performance.

### 4. **Internationalization (i18n) Support**
   - Add multi-language support to the app, allowing users to switch between different languages. Use libraries like `react-i18next` for efficient implementation.

### 5. **Unit and Integration Testing**
   - Expand testing coverage by adding more unit and integration tests using libraries like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure the application’s functionality is well-tested.
